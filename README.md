A high-performance, real-time process monitoring solution that bridges C++ efficiency with Python's elegant GUI capabilities. **Numen Sentinel** provides deep insights into system processes with minimal overhead.

## üìú Etymology & Significance

The name **Numen Sentinel** carries deep historical and philosophical significance:

*"Numen"* (plural: *numina*) originates from Roman and Latin culture, where it represented a divine spirit or supreme being. In Roman religion and mythology, a numen was considered a spiritual force or divine will present in all things, governing and influencing both the natural world and human affairs.

Derived from the Latin noun *numen* (meaning "divine will, divine power, divinity"), it described the divine presence or emanation inhabiting particular locations, objects, or persons. The numen commanded reverence and respect as a source of power and authority.

Just as the ancient numina watched over and guided their domains, **Numen Sentinel** serves as a vigilant guardian of your system's processes, providing divine-like oversight of your computer's operations. This name reflects our application's role as a protective, all-seeing monitor of system resources and processes.
